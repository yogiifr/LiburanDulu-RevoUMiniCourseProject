Welcome to LiburanDulu App, your one-stop solution for planning and booking exciting travel adventures! This project is my first endeavor in applying my basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, developed through the Revo U mini-course project.

## About the Project

As a Software Engineer, I was tasked with creating a website for travel agents that offers a seamless experience for users. The website is designed to showcase various travel packages, provide essential information about destinations, and allow users to submit their personal information and travel inquiries through a user-friendly form.

## Features

- **Banner Section**: The homepage features an eye-catching banner that entices users to explore the exciting travel packages offered by LiburanDulu.

- **Travel Packages Information**: Users can find detailed information about the various travel packages, including destination highlights, itineraries, and pricing.

- **JavaScript Validation**: The website implements JavaScript validation to ensure accurate and complete information is collected from users when they submit their personal details and travel inquiries. The form validates the Name, Email, and Travel Destination fields to enhance user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The website's structure and content are built using HTML.

- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS, a powerful and modern CSS framework, is utilized for styling the website.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used to provide interactivity and validate user input in the inquiry form.

## How to Use

To access the LiburanDulu website, simply follow the [link](https://revou-fundamental-course.github.io/24-07-23-yogiifr/) provided. Once on the website, explore the travel packages and find the perfect adventure for your next vacation. To make an inquiry, fill out the user-friendly form, and the JavaScript validation will ensure you provide accurate information.
